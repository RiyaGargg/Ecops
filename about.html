                     Generally many crimes seen by the public will not reach to the police due to many reasons like fear, lack of time, ignorance. 
					 Due to this reason many cases are not even reaching the police station. Though some cases are registered they are not investigated properly due to lack of evidences and cooperation of the public. 
					 This software helps the public to report about the crimes to the police with out any fear in correct time.
					 This is helpful to police in solving the cases .
					 This is also helpful for higher authorities of police to have an overview about the progress of the investigation.
